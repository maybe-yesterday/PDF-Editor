# 📄 PDF Editor: Because Acrobat is a Nightmare

**Ever tried to add an image to your PDF but became incredibly frustrated at Adobe Acrobat?** **Ever wanted to edit your PDF without uploading your private documents to sketchy "Free PDF Editor" websites?**

Welcome to the **PDF Editor**. We don't "reflow" your text, we don't mess up your fonts, and we definitely don't charge a monthly subscription just to paste a signature. 

## 🚀 Why Use This?

Most PDF editors try to be smart. They try to turn your PDF back into a Word document, which inevitably turns your pdf into a pile of scrambled eggs. 

**This PDF Editor is dumb.** It treats your PDF like a piece of paper (like what it should be). We just put "stickers" (images and text) on top of it. It’s fast, it’s local, and it actually works.

## ✨ The "No-Headache" Features
* **Drag-and-Drop Sanity:** Move your signature exactly where it belongs. No "Send to Front" buttons that do nothing.
* **Real-Time Scaling:** A slider that actually resizes your image instantly. Imagine that!
* **Zero Sketchiness:** Your files stay on your computer. No cloud, no uploads, no data harvesting.
* **High-Def Output:** We burn your images into the PDF stream at full resolution. Your signature won't look like it was faxed from 1994.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repo
